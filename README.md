# QTM 350 - Data Science Computing

## Quiz 02: Creating a Website with Quarto and GitHub Pages

### Instructions

In this quiz, you will create a website using Quarto and GitHub Pages as shown in our previous lectures. The website will contain four pages:

- An index (home) page with a title, one sentence about the Gapminder dataset, and links to the other three pages.
- A page with a graph showing the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita over time.
- A page analysing the relationship between life expectancy and population.
- A page analysing changes in life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for a specific country over time.

The website should be published on GitHub Pages and the link to the website should be submitted on Canvas. You can use either R or Python to create the graphs and the analysis. A short description of the dataset is provided here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html>.

The dataset is available in this repository as `gapminder.csv`, and it contains 6 columns and 1,704 rows. The columns are: `country`, `continent`, `year`, `life_expectancy`, `population_millions`, and `gdp_per_capita`. The dataset contains information about these variables in 142 countries over the years 1952 to 2007, with a 5-year interval. If you would like to create the dataset yourself, you can run the code below.

```python
# Install packages
# !pip install pandas gapminder

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from gapminder import gapminder

# Rename 'lifeExp' to 'life_expectancy' and 'gdpPercap' to 'gdp_per_capita'
gapminder = gapminder.rename(columns={'lifeExp': 'life_expectancy',
                                      'pop': 'population_millions', 
                                      'gdpPercap': 'gdp_per_capita'})

# Convert population to millions
gapminder['population_millions'] = gapminder['population_millions'] / 1_000_000

# Create a new pandas DataFrame from the modified gapminder data
gapminder_df = pd.DataFrame(gapminder)

# Save the DataFrame as a CSV file
gapminder_df.to_csv('gapminder.csv', index=False)
```

### Tasks

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. Create a new Quarto website project in your local cloned folder (use `.` if asked to choose your directory).

3. In your local folder, create another folder named `docs` to store the rendered website. This is the folder that will be published on GitHub Pages.

4. Modify the `_quarto.yml` file to include navigation links to your pages and direct the output to the `docs` folder.

5. Modify the `index.qmd` file to include a title, a one-line description of the Gapminder dataset, and links to the other website pages.

6. Create a page entitled `life-gdp.qmd` analysing the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita. Give it a title, a brief introduction, and a graph. Show your code. Also give it a link in the index page with the text "Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita".

7. Create a page entitled `life-population.qmd` analysing the relationship between life expectancy and population. Do the same as in the previous task, but change the title and the link text to "Life Expectancy and Population".

8. Create a page entitled `country.qmd` analysing changes in life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for a specific country over time. Give it a title, a brief introduction, and a graph. Show your code. Also give it a link in the index page with the text "Country Analysis".

9. Ensure the `_quarto.yml` file includes navigation links with custom names.

10. Change the theme of the website to one of Quarto's available themes. You can find the list of themes here: <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html>.

11. Render the website and output the files to the `docs` folder.

12. Add, commit, and push the changes to your forked repository.

13. Go the repository settings on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages to publish the website. Remember to select the `docs` folder as the source.

14. Check that the website is live and all pages are accessible.

15. Copy the GitHub Pages link and submit it on Canvas as instructed.

### Bonus Questions

16. Enhance the website's appearance by adding a custom CSS file.

17. Include an interactive map showing countries' life expectancy or GDP per capita. For this task, you can use the `plotly` library in Python, the `leaflet` library in R, or any other library you prefer.
